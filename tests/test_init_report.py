"""Unit tests for what ``habit-hooks init`` says about a plan.

Every case here is somebody's first ten minutes with the tool, so the lines are
asserted for what they let the reader do next: install a plugin, install a tool,
run habit-hooks, or write a plugin of their own. A report with nothing to do at
the end of it is the loop init exists to break.

What init decides is ``test_initialise.py``; what it then runs is
``test_init_command.py``.
