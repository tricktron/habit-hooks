"""Every shipped sensor and transformer spells ``argv``.

``argv`` is spawned with no shell in between, and is the only form that runs on
native Windows — a ``command`` string is text for ``bash``, which Windows has
not got (and where ``bash`` resolves, it is usually the WSL launcher, answering
from another filesystem entirely). ``command`` stays in the contract for a
third-party plugin that needs syntax a list cannot carry, and is refused at run
time off POSIX; nothing this repo ships needs it any more. A new part added as
a ``command`` string would be dead on Windows without anything saying so — this
is the gate that notices.
