"""Every catalogued smell must ship a real coaching guide.

The product's value is the coaching. A smell in ``catalogue.DEFAULT_SEVERITY``
with no ``guides/<smell>.md`` falls through to the one-size ``uncoached.md``,
silently degrading the product. This test turns that gap into a build failure so
it cannot reopen (#101).

It routes each smell through the real ``rendering._resolve_guide`` against the
full installed plugin set, exactly as a live run would, and asserts the resolved
guide is not the uncoached fallback.
