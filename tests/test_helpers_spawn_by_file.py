"""How a plugin's own helper spawns the third-party tool it wraps.

No sensor habit-hooks ships names its wrapped tool as a part's ``argv[0]``: each
runs a helper script, and the helper spawns ``jscpd``, ``pmd``, ``php`` or
``deptry`` itself. So the core resolving a part's program settles nothing for
them — the tools that actually go missing on Windows go missing one process
further in, which is why ``sensors/tool_spawn.py`` sits beside each helper.

It is a copy in each plugin because each plugin is a separately installable
distribution declaring no dependency on ``habit-hooks``: a helper cannot import
the core, and small copies beat a dependency that does not exist. What keeps the
copiescopies honest is the first case here — they are one file, byte for byte, so
whichever of them is exercised below answers for all of them.

The lookup is not a second answer to the core's: habit-hooks hands a helper a
``PATH`` of the project's own bins (``sensors/spawn._path_env``), so
``shutil.which`` inside the helper asks exactly what ``missing_tools`` asked
when it cleared the tool. What it adds is the spelling, and which filenames a
machine runs for a bare name is that machine's own rule, reached through no seam
of ours — so the two halves of that story are pinned to hosts, as
``test_tool_resolution.py`` pins the core's.
