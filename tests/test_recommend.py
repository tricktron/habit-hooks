"""Unit tests for what the plugin recommendation tells you to do.

Installing a plugin does not switch it on — a plugin runs only when the project's
``plugins`` list names it. A hint that says `pip install` to someone who has
already installed it is a loop with no exit, so each hint names the step its
reader is actually missing. Which languages count as used at all is
``docs/habit-sensors.spec.md``.
