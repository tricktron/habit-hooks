"""The fixtures a test module names in a signature rather than importing.

A fixture reads as an unused import wherever it is declared, so every shared one
lives here. Four kinds so far:

* the one installed-wheel install both installed-run modules measure against —
  ``test_installed_wheel_smoke`` asks whether the core can find its plugins once
  packaged and ``test_installed_plugin_packaging`` whether each plugin brought
  what its sensors need; both need the same throwaway venv, and building the
  wheels twice to answer two halves of one question is a minute of every suite
  run;
* the project an ``init`` case asks its question of, whose plugins and whose
  tools are the ones the case wrote rather than whatever this machine has;
* the machine such a case runs on, stripped of the plugins ``uv sync`` installs
  for development, because a case about a plugin nobody has cannot be written on
  a machine that has them all;
* the installation habit-hooks itself is running from, which decides the command
  ``init`` offers for a plugin nobody has — asked by two modules, and written
  out in full, down to the ``pyvenv.cfg``, since otherwise which command that is
  would depend on the machine the suite runs on.
