# DECISIONS

Design calls for the `simplified` rewrite — a ground-up re-org to cut cruft (the
old single-package, TS-baked design was ~5.6k non-test LOC for behaviour that is
a few small pipes). Calls are _human requested_ (Ivett) unless noted.

- **The pipeline is composed commands** — `habit-sensors | habit-mapper` —
  carrying a JSON array of `{smell, language?, details}` findings. `habit-mapper`
  absorbs the old mapper **and** guide stages (route + render + exit). Snoozing
  and adapting are **sensors**, not separate stages.

- **Everything language/tool-specific lives in `plugins/<language>` and
  `plugins/generic`** — each a dir of `sensors/*.toml` specs and `guides/` files,
  contract-only. Generic owns the language-independent sensors (line-count →
  oversized-file, jscpd → duplicated-code). TS keeps eslint/knip/comment; Python
  keeps ruff/deptry.

- **A sensor is a single `.toml`** carrying `command` + `produces` (+ optional
  `language`/`dependsOn`/`files`). It just has to print the findings array; an
  adapter sensor maps a JSON-emitting tool with a `jq` transform in the command
  ([authoring-plugins.spec.md](authoring-plugins.spec.md)). One descriptor source,
  read statically — no `--describe` subprocess. _(Ivett's call over the agent's
  two-source proposal.)_

- **`.habit-hooks/` in a consumer holds overrides only** (Q1b) — project
  `config.toml` plus any sensor/guide it replaces. Defaults resolve from the
  package, so updating habit-hooks never clobbers tuning. Resolution is
  first-match across `.habit-hooks/<lang>` → `.habit-hooks/generic` →
  `plugins/<lang>` → `plugins/generic`.

- **`oversized-file` defaults to the generic line-count sensor; languages may
  override.** TS uses eslint's `max-lines` instead (disables `line-count` in its
  config, maps `max-lines`); Python keeps the generic sensor. The pattern for any
  generic-vs-language-native smell: generic default, language override.

- **No composite ships by default.** The composite mechanism (`dependsOn` +
  stdin) stays first-class in the contract, but `needs-extraction` was only ever a
  demonstrator — it moves to a demo project. Docs still cite it for the mechanism.

- **Config is TOML** (Q5).

- **The rebuild targets Python** — chosen over a TypeScript build (Python is more
  often present in polyglot dev tooling and avoids shipping binaries) and over a
  Go binary (zero-runtime + Windows, but adds release machinery).

- **Snooze keying: git by default, mtime fallback** — content-accurate without
  hashing every file; pluggable for free since snooze is a filter sensor.
  _(SUPERSEDED by issue-key snooze below — mtime/git keying is dropped.)_

- **Fixes run via configured runners, not direct execution** — only `.md` is
  rendered by default; `[runners]` maps a guide extension to a command, so no
  arbitrary execution ships out of the box.

## Pipeline redesign (2026-06, all Ivett's calls)

The sensor runner is a recursive **ETL pipeline**. These supersede the
earlier `dependsOn` / composite / augment-replace / snooze-keying notes above.
Pinned in [habit-sensors.spec.md](habit-sensors.spec.md).

- **Two roles, one interface (`findings → findings`).** A **sensor** senses (no
  finding input) over scoped files. A **transformer** takes the whole findings
  array on stdin and returns a new one, with one invariant: **it must pass
  through everything it does not handle.** That single rule replaces `dependsOn`,
  augment/replace modes, shadow-on-re-emit, the `output` sink, topological
  ordering, and the `["*"]` wildcard — all deleted.

- **Recursive concat-then-transform.** A node = `transformers ∘ concat(child
  sensors)`, evaluated in listed order; it composes recursively, so the root
  (`habit-sensors`) and each plugin are the same shape. Transformer order is just
  list order; `snooze` is a root transformer because that is where it sees every
  finding.

- **A plugin is a bundle, not a language** — `sensors/` + `transformers/` +
  `guides/` + `config.toml`. `plugins` (renamed from `languages`) lists the
  active ones, `generic` explicit so it can be dropped. A plugin **declares** its
  `language` in config (generic declares none); the runner stamps it. Because
  language is declared, not the plugin name, **multiple plugins can share a
  language** (e.g. `eslint` and `biome`, both `typescript`).

- **The `plugins` list is ordered = lookup priority.** It is the concat order
  here and the guide-resolution order in the mapper: walk plugins in order, stop
  at the first that handles `(smell, language)`, then fall back to `generic`.
  (Reverses the earlier "derive language from the plugin dir name" Phase 0
  resolution — language is now a declared plugin attribute.)

- **Finding contract gains a top-level `issues`.** `{smell, language?, details,
  issues}` where `details` is the smell-level bag and `issues` is a list of
  `{key, details}` — each issue carrying its own `details` bag, symmetric with
  the finding's. (Was `details.issues` of flat bags.)

- **Snooze is issue-key based, not mtime.** `snooze` drops issues whose `key` is
  in the checked-in index (keyed on `key` alone; `key` defaults to the filename,
  so the common case snoozes a whole file). The sensor chooses the key, so
  lapse-on-change becomes a key-design choice (embed content to auto-lapse), not
  a core feature. `--prune` drops keys absent from the latest run.
  _(AMENDED by "Lapse-on-change is a second transformer" below — the index is
  still keyed on `key` alone, but lapse-on-change is available from the core.)_

- **`produces` dropped from sensor specs** — it only fed ordering/activation;
  ordering is gone, so sensors always run.

- **One `config.toml` for both stages** — the runner reads
  `plugins`/`transformers`/`sensors`/`files`/`scope`; the mapper reads
  `smells`/`runners`. They ignore each other's sections; no physical split.

- **Guide fixers are part of the plugin bundle.** The bare core renders only
  `.md` guide templates; nothing executes otherwise. A plugin ships its own
  `[runners]` in its `config.toml` (resolved through the override chain), mapping
  a guide extension to a command, so a plugin can run its **own
  language-specific fixers** out of the box — e.g. the python plugin maps
  `py = "python"` and its `guides/<smell>.py` scripts run. A project can add or
  override a runner the same way. No arbitrary execution ships unless a plugin or
  the project opts in.

- **Every documented config key has a consumer, or is gone (#87).** Four keys the
  docs described as working were read by nothing. Dispositions:
  - **Plugin `[runners]` — implemented.** `config.load_config` now merges each
    active plugin's `[runners]` under the project's, the way `files` is merged
    (earlier plugin wins a key, project wins over all). This is what the decision
    above always promised; the merge finally exists, so a third-party plugin
    shipping `guides/<smell>.<ext>` plus a `[runners]` entry has its fixer run.
  - **`[sensors.<name>] files` (and a sensor spec's own `files`) — implemented as
    a narrowing.** The `Part` carries the sensor's globs; `Execution` filters the
    already-resolved `scope.files` to that subset for the sensor alone (shared
    `scope.matching`). This is **not** a second scope mechanism: the scope is
    still derived once in `resolve_scope`, and a sensor's `files` can only select
    a subset of what it picked — never widen, never re-derive. `args` and `files`
    override the sensor spec's default wholesale, through one `_sensor_setting`.
  - **`[sensors.<name>] command` / `language`, and a sensor spec's own
    `language` — deleted.** A project wanting a different command or stamped
    language replaces the whole `sensors/<name>.toml` via the override chain, and
    a sensor's language is inherited from its plugin's `config.toml`; per-sensor
    copies read by nothing were removed from `SensorOverride` and the docs.
  - **`SmellOverride.title` — deleted.** Surfaced by the field-has-a-consumer
    test: `title` (and a `description` shown alongside it in an example) routed
    nothing — `severity` does — so both left the docs and `title` left the
    dataclass. `args` was added to the `[sensors.<name>]` doc tables, which had
    omitted the one per-sensor override that always worked.

  The guard against the class recurring is #102 (reject unknown keys); this
  cleared the existing instances. `tests/test_config.py` asserts, parameterised
  over `SensorOverride`/`SmellOverride` fields, that each has a consumer, so a
  future dead field fails the build.

- **Scope surface = main's, restored, plus `--file`** — `--all`, `--branch
  [base]`, `--last <n>`, `--since <ref>`, `--file <path>`, `--config <path>`;
  default from `[scope]` (`changedOnly` → uncommitted; else `autoBranchOffMain`
  → vs base unless on `mainBranch`; else all).

- **Specs build fixture plugins in temp** via the `.habit-hooks/<plugin>`
  override chain (no plugins ship in this repo long-term); the harness `📄 @<src>`
  copy gains recursive-directory support for larger fixtures.

## Deferred (migrated from the now-deleted open_questions.md)

- **Plugins as separately-installable packages.** Agreed direction: plugins
  eventually ship independently (`@habit-hooks/typescript`, etc.) for independent
  release + community contribution. For now the in-repo `plugins/<plugin>` model
  stands; the package split is a later, additive step.
- **`init`'s new shape.** The old ~1.3k-line scaffolder is slated for deletion in
  favour of copying override templates into `.habit-hooks/`. Revisit once its
  much smaller shape is decided.

The three earlier design gaps (sensor-command bin resolution, conditional adapter
mapping, config validation) are resolved and recorded above / in
[checklist.md](checklist.md).

## Tests are not exempt from quality tooling (2026-07, issue #75)

- **Test code is production code; never exempt tests from linting / complexity /
  duplication tooling.** The only legal test-specific carve-out is treating test
  files as **entry points during dead-code detection** (they are roots, not dead
  code), so a symbol used only by tests is not falsely flagged as unused and the
  test file itself is not reported as an unused file.
- **Removed exemptions:** the typescript plugin's `eslint.config.mjs` no longer
  turns `max-lines` / `max-lines-per-function` off for `*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts` /
  `tests/**` — every size/complexity rule now applies to test `.ts` **and** `.tsx`
  (the base block already scopes `["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]`). The generic plugin's
  `.jscpd.json` (and the repo-root dogfood copy) no longer ignore `**/*.test.ts`,
  so duplication in test files is detected.
- **knip (kept, extended):** test files stay listed as `entry` — the legal
  dead-code exemption above. Entry globs were widened to `.tsx` and `.spec`
  variants so co-located React/component tests are treated as roots too (else knip
  reports them as unused files). `ignore: ["tests/**"]` is **kept deliberately**:
  narrowing it to surface unused helpers in a separate `tests/` tree would require
  pulling `tests/**` into `project` scope and enumerating every test-file
  convention as an entry, trading a small gain for real false-positive churn
  across diverse consumer layouts. Co-located tests under `src/` are already in
  scope, so their unused helpers are already surfaced.
- **Deleted** the stale `prompts/build-habit-hooks-overnight.md` overnight
  build-scaffold prompt, which had documented the (now-removed) test exemption as
  intended behaviour.

## Lapse-on-change is a second transformer (2026-08, issue #80, Ivett's call)

- **The default `snooze` does not change, and stays the default.** A project
  upgrading from 1.0.x must never find its snoozes re-arming by themselves; a
  recorded snooze still lasts until someone takes the key out of the index.
- **`snooze-until-changed` is the opt-in ratchet.** Same index, same key
  semantics, but an exemption holds only while its file is unchanged against
  `[scope] branchBase`. That is what the npm predecessor's `snoozedAtCommit`
  gave, and what makes a baseline a ratchet rather than a permanent exemption
  list: debt is exempt until you are editing the file anyway. It ships from the
  core next to `snooze`, so opting in is one word in `transformers`.
- **Why not just design better keys** (the amended decision above): no sensor
  ever encoded content in a key, so the ratchet simply vanished. Keeping the
  index keyed on `key` alone and moving the question into the drop decision
  leaves the index format and `--prune` untouched.
- **An issue is anchored to `details.file`, falling back to `key`.** A sensor
  keys by whatever groups issues best — `deptry` by module, `knip` by export —
  so the key is not always a path; all eight shipped sensors carry
  `details.file`.
- **Measured from the merge base of `branchBase` and `HEAD`**, not the base ref's
  tip, so a branch is only ever judged on the debt it touched itself; work landed
  on the base ref afterwards lapses nothing.
- **A path git cannot place means "unchanged"; a ref it cannot resolve is fatal.**
  Untracked files and projects without a repository keep their snoozes — the
  opposite would re-arm a whole index on an answer git never gave. But a
  `branchBase` missing from a real repository (a shallow CI checkout, a `master`
  trunk) would answer "unchanged" for *every* file and make every snooze
  permanent with no signal — the exact silent green #80 was filed about — so it
  exits non-zero instead. `execution._transform` turns that into a failed run
  that keeps the findings untransformed.

## Finding paths are anchored at the sensor boundary (2026-08, issue #79, agent decision)

- **Every `details.file` is re-expressed relative to the project as a sensor's
  findings enter the run** — `sensors/finding_paths.py`, called from
  `Execution.run_sensor` — rather than by each sensor. `ruff`, `eslint` and
  `ts-morph` report absolute paths, so a snooze index recorded from them matched
  nothing on a teammate's checkout or in CI: machine-specific keys, silently
  evaporating a whole team's baseline now that snooze runs by default. Anchoring
  in one place is what makes a sensor obey a convention it never heard of, which
  is the difference between a framework invariant and a per-project patch.
- **A `key` is anchored by the same rule as the file**, whatever spelling the
  sensor used (`./src/a.py`, an absolute path, a redundant `src/../src`). No
  special case is needed for the carve-out: a key that is not a path (`deptry`
  keys by module, `knip` by export name) has nothing to resolve and comes back
  byte for byte. Tying the rewrite to "the key equals the file" instead — the
  first attempt — left an oddly-spelled key un-anchored *and* split one sensor
  key into two, which hid the aliasing below.
- **A path that cannot be anchored fails its sensor** — an absolute path outside
  the project, or a relative one escaping it. It raises `SensorError`, so it
  surfaces as a notice and a failed run through the existing contract, and that
  sensor's findings are dropped rather than keyed on a guess that would match
  nothing anywhere.
- **A key that is one of its own files while covering others too fails the run**,
  but keeps the findings: they are sound, it is snoozing them that is not. It goes through the
  notice channel — the run's only "somebody has to look at this" channel — since
  a warning nobody must act on is exactly how #79 stayed invisible for so long.
  Non-path keys are exempt by the rule above, so `knip` reporting the same unused
  export name in two files fails nobody's run.
- **Malformed output fails by name, never as a traceback.** An issue that is not
  an object, a `details` that is not one, an `issues` that is not a list: this
  boundary reads programs nobody here wrote, so it must degrade like a broken
  sensor rather than escape `pool.map` and out of `main`.
- **No existence check.** Rejecting a path that does not resolve to a file (the
  issue's option 2) would fail runs over deleted paths, which git-scoped runs
  still hand to sensors today (#81), so anchoring stays lexical. Two shapes
  therefore stay undetectable, and the docs say so rather than implying
  otherwise: a sensor reporting *identical* wrong paths for two files (they look
  like one file), and a key matching none of its files (indistinguishable from a
  deliberate grouping key). The shipped `jscpd` sensor was checked against
  jscpd 4 and reports cwd-relative paths in every invocation shape, so the
  reported case comes from a project-local sensor, not from ours.
- **Cross-sensor aliasing is out of scope.** `aliasing_notices` runs per sensor,
  but `snooze.py` stores bare, un-namespaced keys for the whole run — so two
  *different* sensors emitting one key for different files (a `deptry` module and
  a `knip` export both called `requests`) still alias with no notice. Fixing that
  means namespacing the index (`<sensor>#<key>` or `<smell>#<key>`), which is an
  index-format migration, not a boundary change.
- **Migration:** an index entry recorded before this change from an absolute-path
  sensor no longer matches, so its issues come back. Re-snooze once
  (`habit-sensors --all | habit-snooze --snooze`), then `--prune` drops the stale
  absolute keys.

## The scope is narrowed once, for every mode (2026-08, issue #81, agent decisions)

- **Both narrowings live in `resolve_scope`, not in the sensors.** Whatever mode
  picked the paths, a path the work tree no longer has is dropped and what
  survives must match `[files]`. Every git mode used to hand `git diff
  --name-only` straight through, so a deleted path reached `line-count.py`
  (`FileNotFoundError`, exit 1, empty stdout — read as a clean run, #78) and a
  lockfile bump produced `oversized-file: pnpm-lock.yaml`. Fixing it per sensor
  would mean every sensor, in every plugin, re-implementing the same two guards,
  and any third-party sensor getting it wrong by not knowing they existed.
- **`[files]` applies to `--file` too.** One setting answers "what does this
  project consider source", or it answers nothing: an editor hook firing on a
  lockfile edit must not score the lockfile. The cost is that `--file` on a path
  outside `files` scans nothing — the same answer `--all` gives it.
- **Scope now measures from the merge base, like `changed_files` does.** Two-dot
  `git diff <base>` compares the base ref's *tip* to the work tree, so a branch
  was scoped in files somebody else changed on the base after it forked — the
  gate failing on debt this branch never touched. The consequence differed from
  the same reading in snooze (there it lapsed an exemption; here it merely lints
  extra files), but the question is identical — "what has this branch changed?" —
  and two answers to one question is how #80 and #81 became separate bugs. One
  reading now serves both, and `[scope] branchBase` means the same thing wherever
  it is read.
- **A base ref a real repository cannot resolve fails the run**, the same
  distinction `changed_files._comparison_point` draws, by the same
  `git rev-parse --verify --quiet <ref>^{commit}` exit codes. Git answers a ref
  it never heard of with an empty diff, so a typo'd `branchBase`, or a shallow CI
  checkout without the base, scanned *nothing* and reported every sensor clean.
  "No repository" still outranks it — that is the existing, clear `SystemExit`,
  and it is checked first. The message names the ref and whatever chose it
  (`[scope] branchBase`, `--branch`, `--since`, `--last`), because the remedy
  differs per mode.
- **`files` is the one root key a plugin supplies a default for**, and the merge
  is a union across the active plugins in `plugins` order, deduped, with the
  project's own list replacing it wholesale (replace-on-override, as
  `transformers` and `[sensors.*] args` already are). Union rather than
  first-wins because a polyglot project's source is the sum of what its plugins
  call source; order is kept because pathspec reads the list in order, so a later
  pattern can negate an earlier one. A plugin that declares no `files`
  (`generic`) states *no opinion*, not "everything" — otherwise every union would
  be everything and the default would be worthless. The three shipped language
  plugins had declared `files` since they were written, and nothing ever read the
  key.
- **Supersedes the "No existence check" note above (#79)**, which argued that
  anchoring must stay lexical because git-scoped runs hand deleted paths to
  sensors. They no longer do. Anchoring stays lexical for the reason that
  outlived that one: a sensor may report a path the scope never handed it, and a
  boundary that reads somebody else's program should resolve names rather than
  ask the filesystem.

## A failed run coaches itself with a reserved smell (#88)

- **A run that did not complete never renders as clean.** The two stages talk
  only through findings on a pipe, so a broken sensor — which contributes no
  findings — left the mapper with `[]` and it rendered `clean.md` over broken
  tooling, showing an agent a ✅ next to a failure. Fixed by **Option 1** of the
  issue: the sensors stage appends one reserved `incomplete-run` finding whenever
  the run failed (`Run.failed`), carrying each stderr notice as an issue's
  `content`. Chosen over widening the stage contract (Option 2) because it keeps
  the "the pipe carries findings" invariant intact — a project can still insert
  its own transformers — and the failure arrives with its own coaching, which
  fits a tool whose whole job is coaching. `incomplete-run` is `enforced` and
  ships a core guide (`guides/incomplete-run.md`), so the mapper coaches it and
  fails the run even when no plugin supplies a guide, and needs no new awareness
  of the sensors stage. The finding is appended **after every transformer runs**,
  so a snooze can never mute it; the notices still reach stderr for humans.
- **A stage that dies before writing is the same invariant, one layer down**
  (agent decision). The reserved finding only travels if `habit-sensors` reaches
  its `stdout.write`; a `ToolError` before that — a missing plugin, a rejected
  config, an unresolvable ref — leaves the pipe empty, and `read_findings`
  mapped empty stdin to `[]`, so the ✅ was still printed over a scan that never
  ran. Fixing only the pipeline exit code (`hooks.py`) is not enough: the exit
  code is not what a consuming agent reads, the ✅ line is. `read_findings` now
  returns `None` for a wholly empty stream, distinct from the `[]` of a
  completed empty run, and the mapper raises the same reserved finding against
  itself. Zero bytes is a sound signal precisely because a completed stage
  always writes at least `[]`.
- **`incomplete_run_finding` moved to `catalogue.py`**, beside the smell it
  names, because both stages now raise it and the mapper must not import the
  sensors stage to build one finding.
- **The empty-stream path exits 2, not 1** (agent decision), and renders
  directly rather than through `run`. Exit 1 means an enforced finding — a
  statement about the code; this is #103's "failure of the tool itself", and the
  underlying cause is literally one of the three that contract names. It also
  keeps `hooks.py`'s `mapper.returncode or sensors.returncode` from masking the
  sensors' own 2 with a 1. Bypassing `run` skips the `is_disabled` filter on
  purpose: `[smells.incomplete-run] disabled` is a statement about code smells,
  not a licence to report a scan that never happened as clean.

## `--prune` reads a snooze-free run, and never empties on nothing (#94, agent decision)

- **`--prune` must not read the snooze-filtered pipe.** `transformers` defaults
  to `["snooze"]`, so a plain `habit-sensors` has already stripped every snoozed
  finding before `--prune` sees stdin. The documented
  `habit-sensors --all | habit-snooze --prune` therefore kept only the index keys
  present in a stream that by construction held none of them, rewriting the whole
  index to `[]` with exit 0 — one run silently destroying a team's baseline.
- **The seam is a `habit-sensors --no-snooze` flag**, not `--prune` re-scanning
  itself. The flag drops the snooze transformers (`SNOOZE_TRANSFORMERS`) from the
  run so the pipe carries the pre-snooze findings, and the README pipeline uses
  it. Chosen over `transformers = [] via --config` because a documented one-liner
  should not need a config file, and over teaching `--prune` to shell out to the
  runner because the stages still talk only through the pipe.
- **An empty run never empties a populated index.** No findings means "nothing
  was measured" (an empty scope, a snooze-filtered pipe, a crashed sensor), not
  "every exemption is obsolete" — the false-clean class of #78/#84. `--prune`
  refuses and says why (exit 1, index untouched) rather than wiping it.
- **A malformed index fails by name.** `load_index` was `json.loads` with no
  type check: `null` iterated as `None`, a bare `"src/a.py"` iterated per
  character (a silent index of nothing), an object survived only to be flattened
  on the next `--snooze`. It now demands a JSON list of strings and raises
  `SnoozeError` naming the file — a checked-in file a human edits must not fail
  as a traceback or, worse, quietly. It **exits 2**, not 1: the index is part of
  the tool's own inputs, so a broken one is #103's "failure of the tool itself",
  the same as a rejected config key; only the `--prune` refusal above, a
  judgement about the run, stays 1. `save_index` writes a sibling temp file and
  `os.replace`s it, so two concurrent hook runs cannot tear the file.

## Discovery is opt-in — a default install scans nothing (#97, agent decision)

- **No `[files]` at all means an empty scope, not the whole tree.** `_every_file`
  was a bare `rglob("*")`, and with the documented default `plugins = ["generic"]`
  the merged `files` stayed `None`, so nothing narrowed it: a fresh install swept
  `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `dist/` and `.git/` and coached the consumer on
  somebody else's code. Inverting it — `_every_file` refuses to walk the tree
  when there is no `[files]` to narrow it to — makes the posture opt-in: a
  project states what it wants scanned, and anything it has not named is out of
  scope. An exclusion list was the wrong shape; it is only ever right once
  someone remembers every vendor directory their ecosystem invents.
- **Plugin-declared `files` still supply the opt-in.** The merge is unchanged, so
  `plugins = ["python"]` inherits `**/*.py` and scans that, not everything; only
  a project whose plugins all stay silent (bare `generic`) scans nothing.
- **An empty scope for want of `[files]` says why.** Like the `--file` and
  unresolvable-ref notices, a run that measured nothing must never read as clean:
  it prints one stderr line pointing at `.habit-hooks/config.toml`. A `--file`
  hook keeps its own per-file diagnosis, since it fires on every edit — and when
  there is no `[files]` at all, that diagnosis names the missing setting rather
  than saying the file is "outside `[files]`", which points at a section the
  project does not have. Both wordings now come from one place
  (`scope_notices.py`), so the run-level and per-file notices name one setting.
- **This must land after #93.** #97 makes the default scope empty; #93 is the
  guard that stops an empty scope from meaning "scan everything" (a pathless
  `ruff check` defaults to `.`). Landed first, this would turn "sweeps
  `node_modules`" into "ruff scans the whole repository every run" — worse than
  the bug. With #93 first, both intermediate states are safe.
- **A git mode resolves its base ref before the opt-in narrows.** The narrowing
  to nothing happens in `_source_files`/`_every_file`, downstream of the ref
  check, so a typo'd `branchBase` still fails loudly (#81) rather than being
  masked by an empty opt-in.

## Every catalogued smell ships a guide; `unused-export` stays enforced (#101)

- **A catalogued smell with no `guides/<smell>.md` is a silent product
  regression, not a graceful fallback.** The coaching *is* the product, so a
  smell that falls through to the one-size `uncoached.md` is shipping less than
  it claims. Ten catalogued smells had no guide (three firing out of the box for
  every Python consumer), and `unused-variable` had one only in `php` despite
  firing from ruff `F841` and eslint `no-unused-vars` too. Each now ships a
  ROSE-pattern guide in the plugin it belongs to: the language-agnostic ones
  (`unused-variable`, `unused-import`, `unused-dependency`, `unused-file`,
  `duplicate-import`) in `generic`, so every language's routing reaches them via
  the languageless fallback; the TypeScript-specific ones (`explicit-any`,
  `redundant-type-annotation`, `loose-equality`, `var-declaration`,
  `non-const-binding`, `unused-class-member`) in `typescript`.
- **`unused-variable` moved from `php` to `generic` (not copied).** The prose was
  language-agnostic — nothing in it was PHP-specific — so a copy would have been
  duplication that drifts. `php` keeps no override because it has nothing
  PHP-specific to say about an unused local.
- **`tests/test_catalogue_coverage.py` is the gate that stops the gap
  reopening.** It routes every smell in `catalogue.DEFAULT_SEVERITY` through the
  real `rendering._resolve_guide` against the full installed plugin set and fails
  if any renders `uncoached.md`. "Somebody notices missing coaching" is now a red
  build, not a bug report.
- **`unused-export` stays `enforced` — deliberately, and this records why.** The
  old TypeScript version set it to `suggested` with the rationale "either dead
  code, or an internal exposed only for tests". That second horn no longer
  belongs to this smell: the knip default pass counts a test as a real consumer,
  so an export a test uses is never flagged here — it surfaces from the gated
  `--production` pass as its own **`test-only-dead-code`** smell (also enforced).
  What remains under `unused-export` is an export *nothing* references, test
  included: genuinely dead code, or a public API surface knip can't see is
  consumed. The first should block; the second is told to knip via its
  `entry`/config (the guide says so), after which anything still flagged is dead.
  Enforced also keeps the whole `unused-*` family consistent (`unused-variable`,
  `unused-import`, `unused-file`, `unused-dependency`, `unused-class-member` are
  all enforced). A project that wants it advisory sets
  `[smells.unused-export] severity = "suggested"`.

## The Go plugin wraps golangci-lint v2 (2026-08, agent decision)

- **The `go` plugin wraps golangci-lint v2 and maps to seven catalogue smells**
  (`high-complexity`, `oversized-function`, `unused-variable`, `unused-import`,
  `parse-error`, `unchecked-error`, `copied-lock`). The first five pre-date the
  Go plugin; the last two were added for it (both ENFORCED, with Go-specific
  guides). The plugin is a sensor + a bundled config + package scaffolding. Its
  `config.toml` declares `language = "go"`,
  `files = ["**/*.go", "!**/vendor/**"]` and a `golangci-lint` detector; the one
  core change is `go` joining `recommend.LANGUAGE_SIGNALS` (`go.mod`, `.go`), so
  `habit-hooks init` plans the plugin for a Go project and a run recommends it —
  the same table every language plugin joins through, and the only place `init`'s
  "ships plugins for …" line is derived from.
- **Routing is by `FromLinter` + `Text` prefix, not the linter name alone.**
  golangci-lint v2's `unused` reports both an unused local (`var`…) and an unused
  function/type — two different smells under one linter — and `typecheck` reports
  both an unused import and any other compile error. The text is the only
  disambiguator, and the second half of each pair has no home: an unused
  function/type is forwarded as uncoached under the linter's own name (it has no
  guide and no severity, but surfaces through `uncoached.md`), while any non-import `typecheck` is `parse-error`.
- **golangci-lint v2's JSON differs from v1 in every shape the sensor touches.**
  Issues are wrapped (`{"Issues": [...], "Report": {...}}`), the fields are
  `FromLinter`/`Text`/`Pos.Filename`/`Pos.Line`/`Pos.Column`, output goes to
  stdout via `--output.json.path stdout`, and the text formatter is sent to
  stderr (`--output.text.path stderr --show-stats=false`) so stdout stays pure
  JSON. The one force the slice assumed — v1's flat field names and
  `--out-format json` — does not exist in v2.
- **golangci-lint v2 resolves `Pos.Filename` relative to the config file's
  directory, not cwd.** With the bundled fallback (deep inside the installed
  package) that produced `..`-laden paths the core's anchoring rejected. The
  sensor does **not** anchor itself (it respects the boundary in "Finding paths
  are anchored at the sensor boundary") — it re-joins each reported path against
  the config-in-force's directory before emitting, so the core's anchoring
  receives a path pointing into the project. `config_in_force` returns that
  directory: a `--config` named in args → its parent; a discovered `.golangci.yml`
  → cwd; the bundled fallback → the package's own directory.
- **`tool_spawn.py` extends to a fifth byte-identical copy.** Every Python
  plugin (generic, java, php, python, now go) ships its own copy because each
  declares `dependencies = []`; `test_every_plugin_carries_the_same_copy` now
  guards five.
- **The bundled config comes from maratori, and the project's own always wins.**
  `.golangci.yml` (`version: "2"`) enables `gocyclo`, `funlen`, `ineffassign`,
  `unused`, `errcheck`, `govet`, and `staticcheck` — the first four the routing
  table maps, `errcheck` maps fully to `unchecked-error`, `govet` is partially
  mapped (copylocks → `copied-lock`, other analyzers forwarded), and only
  `staticcheck` forwards as uncoached, so a real defect is never
  silently dropped. The sensor threads the config exactly like jscpd/eslint/knip: a project's own config
  (named in args or discovered on disk) is passed to golangci-lint untouched, and
  the bundled one is only the fallback for "this project has none".
- **Pre-`--` args are forwarded to golangci-lint verbatim** — the same
  split-on-the-last-`--` PMD uses, so a project's own `--config` and flags reach
  the tool while `${files}` files follow the separator. Before this, the whole
  `${args}` half was dropped.

## Go smells tier 1: `unchecked-error` and `copied-lock` (2026-08, agent decision)

- **Two new ENFORCED smells, each with its own Go-specific guide.**
  `unchecked-error` maps every `errcheck` finding — an unchecked error return is
  always the same hazard, so there is no text-routing needed. `copied-lock` maps
  govet's copylocks analyzer findings — both shapes (an assignment copying a
  lock-holding value, and a call passing one by value) are the same bug. Both
  ship as ENFORCED with guides under `plugins/go/.../guides/`.
- **`errcheck → unchecked-error`, not `swallowed-exception`.** The catalogue
  already has `swallowed-exception` (suggested), but Go has no exceptions: the
  error is a return value the caller never acknowledged, not an exception caught
  and suppressed. Routing `errcheck` there would mis-coach every Go finding with
  a guide whose remedy (`catch` block) does not exist in the language. A
  dedicated smell with its own guide names the actual fix (check the return or
  explicitly discard it with `_ =`).
- **govet routes on text, following the `unused`/`typecheck` pattern.** govet is
  a multi-analyzer linter under one `FromLinter` name, so — like `unused`
  (`var ` prefix → `unused-variable`, else forwarded) and `typecheck`
  (`imported and not used` → `unused-import`, else `parse-error`) — the sensor
  inspects `Text` to pick the smell. The copylocks analyzer's two reportings
  both contain `copies lock value` or `passes lock by value` and route to
  `copied-lock`; any other govet analyzer's finding is forwarded under `govet`
  as uncoached (it surfaces through `uncoached.md` with suggested severity).
- **The substring is `passes lock by value`, not `passes lock value`.** govet's
  copylocks analyzer emits exactly `passes lock by value` for the call-site
  shape, and the sensor matches that substring verbatim. A shorter `passes lock
  value` would never match and would silently forward every call-site finding
  as uncoached — the exact false-clean the routing exists to prevent.
