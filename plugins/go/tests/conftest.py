"""Load the golangci-lint sensor the way it is actually run — as a loose script.

The sensor spec spells ``${python} ${dir}/golangci_lint_sensor.py``, so the
interpreter puts the helper's own directory first on ``sys.path`` and a unit
test does the same rather than reaching the code as
``habit_hooks_go.sensors.golangci_lint_sensor`` — a load path no run ever takes
(see "A plugin helper imports its neighbours as top-level modules" in
CLAUDE.md).
