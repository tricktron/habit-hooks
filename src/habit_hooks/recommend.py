"""Recommend a plugin for a language the project uses but has no active plugin for.

A non-fatal hint printed to stderr only: it never changes the findings output or
the exit code. Detection is deliberately conservative — a language counts as used
only on a cheap, clear signal (a known config file in the project root or a file
extension among the scoped files). A language whose plugin already declares it is
never recommended.

Installing a plugin does not switch it on: it runs only once the project's
``plugins`` list names it. So the hint names the step its reader is actually
missing — a reader who has the plugin is told to enable it, never to install
what they already have.
